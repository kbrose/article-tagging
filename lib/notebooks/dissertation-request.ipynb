      "were criticized by the [ U.S. Department of Justice ][4] in January as cursory.\n",
      "A closer look at about 100 Taser incidents by some of the most frequent users\n",
      "found that command officers held that the use of force complied with department\n",
      "policy in every instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "•A Tribune review of city Law Department data as well as court records found\n",
      "that the city has paid or agreed to pay at least $23.1 million in lawsuits\n",
      "involving Taser use since 2005.\n",
      "\n",
      "•At least eight people have died since 2005 after Chicago police used Tasers on\n",

      "Americans comprise about one-third of the city's residents. The racial disparity\n",
      "in Taser use mirrors other forms of police contact with citizens, including\n",
      "street stops, and a department spokesman noted that police activity is heavier\n",
      "in violent neighborhoods, some with large African-American populations. The\n",

      "\n",
      "About 72 percent of those targeted by police since 2007 were African-American —\n",
      "some 65 percent of them black males. While whites comprise nearly half of\n",
      "Chicago's population, blacks were about nine times more likely to be targeted by\n",
      "police than whites.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2010 alone, police used Tasers on more than 800 African-Americans, in sharp\n",

      "The percentage of Taser uses involving blacks, though, matches with past studies\n",
      "of the racial breakdown of other types of police activity. Multiple studies of\n",
      "street stops, for example, have found about three-quarters of people stopped\n",
      "were African-American.\n",
      "\n",
      "The department prohibits biased policing, Giancamilli said, but he added that\n",
      "districts with more gun violence — often in predominantly African-American\n",
      "neighborhoods — have more concentrated police activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even in majority-white neighborhoods with little violent crime, officers\n",
      "disproportionately shock African-Americans. For example, in the Shakespeare\n",
      "District, which includes parts of the Bucktown, Logan Square and Wicker Park\n",
      "neighborhoods, African-Americans were involved in about 43 percent of the\n",
      "incidents, while [ 2010 census ][6] figures show that blacks made up less than\n",

      "\n",
      "But slightly less than 1 percent of the some 2,000 officers who triggered a\n",
